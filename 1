# Ethereum Smart Contract Auditing Toolkit

A collection of tools for auditing Ethereum smart contracts. This toolkit includes utilities for:

- Static analysis of Solidity contracts.
- Gas optimization techniques for more efficient deployments.
- Security audit scripts and best practices.

## Features

- **Static Analysis**: Automated checks for common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, uninitialized state variables, etc.
- **Gas Optimization**: Tools for reducing gas usage in smart contracts.
- **Security Auditing**: Guidelines and scripts for identifying potential attack vectors.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethereum-smart-contract-audit-toolkit.git
cd ethereum-smart-contract-audit-toolkit
npm install
node tools/static-analysis/analyze.js <path_to_contract>
node tools/gas-optimization/optimize.js <path_to_contract>
